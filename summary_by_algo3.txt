 Politicians are fully aware of the corruption and nepotism as the main reasons behind the fall of Roman Empire, the French Revolution, October Revolution in Russia, fall of Chiang Kai-Shek Gov­ernment on the mainland of China-and even the defeat of the mighty Congress party in India. The prominence of political corruption in India in the 1990s is hardly unique to India. During the 1980s and 1990s, corruption became associated with the occupants of the highest echelons of India’s political system. This was the outburst of Mahatma Gandhi against rampant corruption in Congress ministries formed under 1935 Act in six states in the year 1937. The disciples of Gandhi however, ignored his concern over corruption in post-Independence India, when they came to power. The Tehelka episode surcharged the political atmosphere of the country but it hardly exposed anything that was unknown to the people of this biggest democratic polity.
