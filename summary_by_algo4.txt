 The extensive role of the Indian state in providing services and promoting economic development has always created the opportunity for using public resources for private benefit.  As government regulation of business was extended in the 1960s and corporate donations were banned in 1969, trading economic favours for under-the-table contributions to political parties became an increasingly widespread political practice.  During the 1980s and 1990s, corruption became associated with the occupants of the highest echelons of India’s political system.  Rajiv Gandhi’s government was rocked by scandals, as was the government of PV Narasimha Rao.  Politicians have become so closely identified with corruption in the public eye that a Times of India poll of 1,554 adults in six metropolitan cities found that 98 percent of the public is convinced that politicians and ministers are corrupt, with 85 percent observing that corruption is on the increase.
