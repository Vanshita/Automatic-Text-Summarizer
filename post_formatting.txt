corruption
not
only
has
become
a
pervasive
aspect
of
indian
politics
but
also
has
become
an
increasingly
important
factor
in
indian
elections


the
extensive
role
of
the
indian
state
in
providing
services
and
promoting
economic
development
has
always
created
the
opportunity
for
using
public
resources
for
private
benefit

as
government
regulation
of
business
was
extended
in
the
s
and
corporate
donations
were
banned
in

trading
economic
favours
for
underthetable
contributions
to
political
parties
became
an
increasingly
widespread
political
practice
during
the
s
and
s
corruption
became
associated
with
the
occupants
of
the
highest
echelons
of
indias
political
system

rajiv
gandhis
government
was
rocked
by
scandals
as
was
the
government
of
pv
narasimha
rao
politicians
have
become
so
closely
identified
with
corruption
in
the
public
eye
that
a
times
of
india
poll
of

adults
in
six
metropolitan
cities
found
that

percent
of
the
public
is
convinced
that
politicians
and
ministers
are
corrupt
with

percent
observing
that
corruption
is
on
the
increase

the
prominence
of
political
corruption
in
india
in
the
s
is
hardly
unique
to
india
other
countries
also
have
experienced
corruption
that
has
rocked
their
political
systems
what
is
remarkable
about
india
is
the
persistent
antiincumbent
sentiment
among
its
electorate
since
indiras
victory
in
her

garibi
hatao
election
only
one
ruling
party
has
been
reelected
to
power
in
the
central
government

in
an
important
sense
the
exception
proves
the
rule
because
the
congress
i
won
reelection
in

in
no
small
measure
because
the
electorate
saw
in
rajiv
gandhi
a
mr
clean
who
would
lead
a
new
generation
of
politicians
in
cleansing
the
political
system
antiincumbent
sentiment
is
just
as
strong
at
the
state
level
where
the
ruling
parties
of
all
political
persuasions
in
indias
major
states
lost
eleven
of
thirteen
legislative
assembly
elections
held
from

through
spring


corruption
in
simple
terms
may
be
described
as
an
act
of
bribery
corruption
is
defined
as
the
use
of
public
office
for
private
gains
in
a
way
that
constitutes
a
breach
of
law
or
a
deviation
from
the
norms
of
society
scales
of
corruption
can
be
grand
middling
or
petty
and
payment
of
bribes
can
be
due
to
collusion
between
the
bribe
taker
and
the
bribe
giver
due
to
coercion
or
even
anticipatory

this
was
the
outburst
of
mahatma
gandhi
against
rampant
corruption
in
congress
ministries
formed
under

act
in
six
states
in
the
year

the
disciples
of
gandhi
however
ignored
his
concern
over
corruption
in
postindependence
india
when
they
came
to
power

over
sixty
years
of
democratic
rule
has
made
the
people
so
immune
to
corruption
that
they
have
learnt
how
to
live
with
the
system
even
though
the
cancerous
growth
of
this
malady
may
finally
kill
it
the
tehelka
episode
surcharged
the
political
atmosphere
of
the
country
but
it
hardly
exposed
anything
that
was
unknown
to
the
people
of
this
biggest
democratic
polity

politicians
are
fully
aware
of
the
corruption
and
nepotism
as
the
main
reasons
behind
the
fall
of
roman
empire
the
french
revolution
october
revolution
in
russia
fall
of
chiang
kaishek
government
on
the
mainland
of
chinaand
even
the
defeat
of
the
mighty
congress
party
in
india
but
they
are
not
ready
to
take
any
lesson
from
the
pages
of
history
